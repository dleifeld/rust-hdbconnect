Major part of the implementation of both `hdbconnect` and `hdbconnect_async`.

## Direct use not recommended

If you want a synchronous rust driver for HANA,
use [`hdbconnect`](https://crates.io/crates/hdbconnect).

If you want an asynchronous rust driver for HANA,
use [`hdbconnect_async`](https://crates.io/crates/hdbconnect_async).
