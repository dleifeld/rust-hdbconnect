//! Asynchronous native rust database driver for SAP HANA (TM).
//!
//! The synchronous sibling of this driver is available as
//! [`hdbconnect`](https://crates.io/crates/hdbconnect).
//!
//! `hdbconnect_async` provides a lean, fast, and easy-to-use asynchronous rust-API for
//! working with SAP HANA. The driver is written completely in rust.
//!
//! It interoperates elegantly with all data types that implement the standard
//! `serde::Serialize` and/or `serde::Deserialize` traits, for input and output respectively.
//! So, instead of iterating over a resultset by rows and columns, you can
//! assign the complete resultset directly to a rust structure that fits the data
//! semantics.
//!
//! `hdbconnect_async` implements this with the help of [`serde_db`](https://docs.rs/serde_db),
//! a reusable library for simplifying the data exchange between application code
//! and database drivers, both for input parameters (e.g. to prepared statements)
//! and for results that are returned from the database.
//!
//! In contrast to typical ORM mapping variants, this approach allows
//! using the full flexibility of SQL (projection lists, all kinds of joins,
//! unions, nested queries, etc). Whatever query you need, you just use it, without further ado
//! for defining object models etc., and whatever result structure you want to read,
//! you just use a corresponding rust structure into
//! which you deserialize the data. It's hard to use less code!
//!
//! See [code examples](crate::code_examples) for an overview.
